= sb-cli

Sample Spring Boot CLI application.

Shows how a link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] application may be configured and packaged to create
native executables with GraalVM Native Image, as well as creating binary distributions (packaged as `.zip` and `.tar.gz`),
finally publishing said binaries as assets on a Git release via link:https://jreleaser.org[JReleaser].
